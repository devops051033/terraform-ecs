Host a Dynamic Web App on AWS with Terraform Module, Docker, Amazon ECR, and ECS

in this project we'll use Terraform Module, Docker, Amazon ECR, and ECS to deploy and manage a dynamic website on AWS. You will learn to interpret Terraform documentation and write code for AWS services.
Prerequisite:

    To help you better understand how Terraform works, first, we deployed the web app in the management console. Then we automate the deployment process with Terraform. 
    Before you begin this Terraform course, it is ESSENTIAL that you first complete the "Host a Dynamic Web App on AWS with Docker, Amazon ECR, and Amazon ECS" project, which is part of this package. This prerequisite will ensure you have the foundational knowledge and experience needed to excel in the Terraform course.
